* Overview
The Chargeback API is a collection of RESTful JSON calls. The API uses standardized HTTP verbs and resource routes. Whenever possible, all JSON results will use a standardized format.

Depending on the access controls granted to the key authorizing the request, some actions may be unavailable.

** Standardized HTTP verbs and routes

Assuming the "orders" resource, the following routes are available:

| Verb | Action | Route             | Purpose                                                                             |
|------+--------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET  | search | /orders.json      | Search existing orders (see Orders section for search keys and return values)       |
|      | show   | /orders/(id).json | Retrieve information about a single order                                           |
| POST | create | /orders.json      | Create a new order.                                                                 |
| PUT  | update | /orders/(id).json | Update an existing order with new information                                       |
| POST | submit | /orders.json      | For convenience, a shortcut method to update or create based on unique identifiers. |

For all "search" operations, no more than 100 records will be returned at a time. The "page" parameter controls which page is returned. If more data exists, the search results will include the link for the subsequent page.

Show, create, update, and submit should return a JSON object that represents the resource. Search will return an array of such JSON objects.
* Authentication
The Chargeback API uses HTTP Basic Authentication. Your username and password combination will have specific rights to access only the resources related to your merchant account.

* Orders
Unique identifiers: crm_id, merchant_id, order_id.
(Order records are assumed unique based on their "order_id" value within the context of a CRM + Merchant combination.)

The 'id' field may be used to uniquely identify the order record for subsequent calls to update, show, and submit. You may also use the order_id, crm, and merchant identifiers to show, update, etc. an order that already exists in the Chargeback database.
* Shipments
The shipments actions are meant to be used in the context of an order. Without specifying an accompanying parent order, shipment information is not meaningful.
** Fields
The only required field is tracking number. Other than this, a subset of the other fields will be populated based on the data pulled by an integration with a shipping partner.

If there is no integration, you may still provide data about the shipments on the order by passing any of these data points to the shipments endpoints.
